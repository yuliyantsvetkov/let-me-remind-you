# let-me-remind-you
Slack bot to remind to every Product manager that they are not an Technical Lead, Team Lead, IT architect, or General manager.

## Introdction

Once upon a time there was a Peoduct manager I worked with.
The person was very eager to improve everything on the horizon that was seen by the same.

Unfortunately having non technical, and lacking the human expertise product oriented person working with IT people only worsened the
ability of the technical teams to deliver.

That was mainly due to the pushy environment created by the Product person. Lacking the ability to understand that delivery is not only functionality, the
same person never went deeper in the technical aspects of the deliverables.

Envying people around the person never understood why Friday Team meetings are useless.

For that same reason the let-me-remind-you bot was created.

A bot that reminds every product person that they are generally wrong to conduct technic and other kind of planning meetings on Fridays.

## Functionality 

The bot will search for configured keywords in targeted slack messages sent by specific people and respond to them with: 'Let me remind you...'.
